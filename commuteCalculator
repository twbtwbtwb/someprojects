 * This program does a cos of commute calculation.  It asks the user to input the

 * the price of gas. Then it calculates the monthly gas expense.  It then prompts
 * the user to input 'Y' or 'y' if they wants to perform another calculation. When
 * finished the program outputs the number of calculations, the total mileage, and
 * the average monthly cost of gas from each calculation.
